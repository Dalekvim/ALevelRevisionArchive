# ALevelRevisionArchieve
## About the Website
This is just an application of my DjangoBlogTemplate to make an Archive of all the stuff I learn in my A Levels so that I can quickly search through them when I'm revising.
## How to Use
You can use the same Archive as me and Contribute to it, or clone and costumise it yourself.  
For more information have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Dalekvim/ALevelRevisionArchive/wiki).
